This directory
--------------

This directory (tools/) contains useful tools for the DICT protocol.

For all those programs, you can get informations about their usage by running
"ruby program-name.rb --help".


Servers
=======


dict-proxy.rb
-------------

dict-proxy.rb is a DICT, over HTTP, proxy. In many companies, only few ports
such as HTTP (80) and FTP (21) are open. This prevents from using DICT clients
inside the company. dict-proxy.rb solves this problem.

"ruby dict-proxy.rb --server" must be run on the local machine and
dict-proxy.rb must be put on an HTTP server for which the DICT server is
accessible. Here is the scenario:

Query:
Client => ruby dict-proxy.rb --server (2628) => dict-proxy.rb on Apache (80)

Response:
Client <= ruby dict-proxy.rb --server (2628) <= dict-proxy.rb on Apache (80)


If dict-proxy.rb itself needs an HTTP proxy to connect to HTTP, use the
$http_proxy environment variable.

dict-server.rb
--------------

dict-server.rb is a basic extendable DICT server. It provides all the bricks so
someone who wants to add support for a new file format only has to write a
simple class.


Format converters
=================


The programs below can be used together with dictfmt, a tool that creates
databases for the dictd server. Lots of dictionaries become thus usable with
the dictd server and so with your favourite DICT client Fantasdic!

edict2dictd.rb
--------------

edict2dictd.rb converts a dictionary in EDICT format (e.g. EDICT [1],
ENAMDICT [2], CEDICT [3]) to a format usable by dictfmt.

kanjidic22dictd.rb
------------------

kanjidic22dictd.rb converts Kanjidic2 [4] to a format usable by dictfmt.

stardict2dictd.rb
----------------

stardict2dictd.rb converts stardict [5] very numerous dictionaries to a format
usable by dictfmt.

tanakacorpus2dictd.rb
---------------------

tanakacorpus2dictd.rb convert the Tanaka Corpus (a set of Japanese-English
sentences) to a format usable by dictfmt.
