In order to keep the code nice and clean we have a few requirements you'll
need to stick to in order to get your patch accepted:

    - use 4-space tabs for indentation and expand tabs to spaces
      (if you use VIM, `set ts=4' and `set et') ; 

    - for code blocks, use { ... } when they can be written into a 
      single line, otherwise use do ... end ;

    - when accessing properties of Ruby-GNOME2 objects, always use
      foo= instead of set_foo ;

    - when hacking the user interface, make sure your changes don't
      break the HIG rules (http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/) ;

    - always provide patches in unified form (`cvs diff -u') and with
      a ChangeLog entry. 

Please do not commit without my permission (mblondel@svn.gnome.org).
