How to use the Makefile in this directory
-----------------------------------------

You should be inside this directory in order to use the Makefile.

make:
        Updates the POT file (fantasdic.pot).

make xx.po:
        (Where xx is a language code.)

        Merge a single PO file with the template. The template is updated if
        necessary.

make po:
        Merges all of the PO files with the template. The template is updated
        if necessary. This command is suitable for generating the PO files to
        send to translators prior to a release.

make check:
        Prints the status of all of the PO files, i.e. how complete each
        translation is. Any problems with the PO files will also be reported.
